This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes 10 classes like airplanes, cats, trucks, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps:
Imported Libraries: TensorFlow, Matplotlib, NumPy.

Data Loading: Used CIFAR-10 dataset and normalized pixel values.

Model Building:

Used Conv2D and MaxPooling layers for feature extraction.

Flattened the data and added Dense layers for classification.

Model Training: Compiled with Adam optimizer and trained for 10 epochs with validation.

Evaluation: Tested on unseen data and reported accuracy.

Visualization:

Accuracy and loss over epochs plotted and saved.

Sample prediction images displayed with predicted vs actual labels.

Output Organization: All outputs saved in a folder named cifar10_output/.

Outcome:
The CNN model achieved good classification performance and produced visual results for better understanding. All code outputs, plots, and model summaries were saved for review or submission.
